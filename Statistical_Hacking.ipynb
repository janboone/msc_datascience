    "# Why statistical hacking?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get started on the \"big data\" part of this course, it is important that you have a good intuition about a number of statistical results that you have seen before in your statistics and econometrics courses. We go over these concepts by simulating our own data. This serves two goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* you fully understand where the data comes from (you generated it yourself)\n",
    "* we train your programming skills in generating the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to generate your data using python simulations is a first step in understanding how to deal with \"real\" data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA) and [this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR52vSbHBAk)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you like, there is also [free book](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/) on this topic using python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to discuss the following topics. First, as you probably know, estimated parameters have a distribution. To illustrate, you may recall that some statistics have a t-distribution. When you move into machine learning, the models get so complicated that there are no analytical results on the distributions of estimated coefficients. So how do you get a sense of uncertainty in that case? You simulate the distribution. Below we show this with examples where you actually know (or should know) what the relevant distributions are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you only have a sample and no knowledge about the underlying model. Then you cannot simulate the distribution. But you can use the sample to learn something about the uncertainty underlying your parameters. This is called bootstrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Economics we are not only interested in predicting variables (like economic growth or stock prices) but we also want to influence them through policy interventions. For this we need to know causal links between variables; not just correlations. Although many people have the intuition that it is better to control for more variables in  a regression, this intuition is actually not correct. By controlling for some variables, you actually mess up your interpretation of an effect in a regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, with \"big data\" it is very tempting to use a lot of variables in your models. You have got all these variables in your \"big data set\" so why not use them? This brings us to the concepts of over- and underfitting."

This is sometimes referred to as \"we do not want the model to become too excited\".\n",

Poverty can be reduced by increasing income but also by avoiding mistakes in expenditures (e.g. not taking out loans with absurdly high interest rates). Suppose the former mechanism is the main one.

    "\n",
    "In the past, when you worked with data, you would usually have 2-dimensional data: columns for the different variables and rows for the different observations. That is, the data is represented as a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, \"big data\" is not necessarily structured in such a neat way. Data can have higher dimensions. We will start with data on images. An image has two dimensions of itself. Hence a dataset with images has 3 dimensions: one dimension for the identifier of the image and then x-y coordinates for the image itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dataset consists of movie-clips, we have an additional dimension: time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In economics, when we look at GDP, our observation would be GDP of the UK in 2010, GDP of the UK in 2011, GDP of Belgium in 2010 etc. This can be represented as a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now suppose we believe the development of GDP is important. Our observation would be GDP of the UK in 2010-2018. This gives 3 dimensional data. The observation is GDP in the period. \n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with higher dimensional data, we need \"tensors\". A tensor generalizes a matrix to higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now have a technical interlude to explain what tensors are and what you can do with them. We describe some functions that can be applied to tensors. To motivate these functions, we will build our first neural network. The point here is not so much to explain how neural networks work but more to show you that the functions we consider are going to be useful later on when we will try to understand neural networks more deeply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning packages tend to have a \"backbone\" that implements tensors. E.g. Keras allows you to work with either [Theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/) or [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)."

    "As mentioned, in most of the empirical analyses that you have done, an observation is a one dimensional vector. E.g. you have data on inflation, unemployment, gdp growth for country-year combinations. Then for the UK in 2000, our data  consists of the one dimensional vector `[inflation, unemployment, gdp growth]`. If you have 100 observations like this, you can represent them in a matrix. Each row is an observation and the columns will be `[coutry, year, inflation, unemployment, gdp growth]`. Hence we have a two dimensional dataset with 100 rows and 5 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In big data, there are usually higher dimension observations. One of the \"classic\" datasets in machine learning is [the MNIST dataset.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) This dataset consists of handwritten numbers and their corresponding label (e.g. when the handwritten number is 5, the label for this image `5`). We will see an example shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is that a handwritten number is a two dimensional observation. For each x-y comination, we get the grey-scale of this point/pixel. To illustrate this, consider the 5th image from the training dataset (python starts numbering at 0); we plot the handwritten image (which is 2 dimensional) and print its label.\n",

    "There are two problems when one does machine learning (or any other form of statistical analysis):\n",
    "* underfitting and\n",
    "* overfitting.\n",

    "Underfitting is the situation where a variable is important to explain $y$ but you do not include it in the regression. As most people have a tendency to include as many variables as possible, this is usually not a problem. Unless, of course, you do not have data on an important variable, but then you cannot really solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is the situation where you include variables in your regression that are actually not relevant. The reason why this happens is that including these variables improves the fit of the model (see above and an example below). But the problem is that you are picking up correlations that are particular to the sample; not a (general) feature of the data generating process.\n",

    "There are a number of ways to deal with this. One is the lasso and ridge regressions we discussed above. Another is the use of an information criterion like [AIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion) and its generalizations. The idea of AIC is to include a penalty in the expression for the fit for the number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you have lots of data (which is the case if you work with \"big data\"), there is a simple way to deal with this: split your data into a train and test set.

If you pick up particular correlations in the train set, your predictions in the test set become worse.\n",

    "Using a train and test set helps to alleviate over- and underfitting problems. But the test set should only be used once. If you repeatedly use the train and test set to see which model is best, you make the same mistake as above but \"on a higher level\": you may find patterns in the train set that generalize only to the test set but not to the data generating process.\n",

    "Suppose you have a train and test set and your trained model does really well on the test set. How do you know that this is not by chance, e.g. due to the way you have split the data into the train and test set? One way to check is to do the analyses for a number of ways in which you can split the data into train and test sets and for each these cases consider the loss on the test set. If this is rather constant across the different ways in which you split the data, you do not need to worry. If this vary wildly between data partitions, something \"odd\" may be going on. \n",

One such example in econometrics is instrumental variables (IV): the first stage in IV is basically generating a prediction.

    "\n",
    "A first (naive) way to analyze this is to regress years of education on wage using an individual level dataset. The problem here is a fork (see our discussion of causality above): personal motivation is likely to affect both educational achievement and wage. If someone has a high level of motivation to succeed in things, they will tend to have a high educational achievement (they are unlikely to drop out of school) and a high wage (they will be successful at their job as well). Hence, such a naive regression is likely to over-estimate the effect of education on wage.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we need is an exogenous variation in educational achievement; hence a variation that is not affected by how motivated a pupil is. In a number of countries the time you spend in school is determined by your date of birth. E.g. in the Netherlands, you go to primary school in the month where you turn 4. In other countries you can drop out of school in the month where you become 16. Hence, depending on your birth date, you spend a couple of months more (or less) in school. We assume that your month of birth is not correlated with how motivated you are when it comes to school and work.\n",

    "We will consider this in the context of unemployed who are offered a training program. To understand the effects, we will again generate our own data such that we know exactly what all the relevant effects are. The question is then, how do we get these effects from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, the learning goals of this section are two fold: (i) learn how to program your own data generating process in python and (ii) understand the statistical issue under considerarion: heterogenous treatment effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The government introduces a training program for unemployed. The treatment variable $D_i$ denotes whether (1) or not (0) individual $i$ received training. The instrument $Z_i$ that we use is whether (1) or not (0) $i$ is invited to join the training. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have three groups of unemployed:\n",

    "* compliers join the training if and only if they are invited to do so: $D_i = 1 (0)$ iff $Z_i = 1 (0)$;\n",

    "* never-takers never join the training: $D_i = 0$ irrespective of $Z_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this training context, the always-takers are a bit \"odd\": how can you join a training program where you are not supposed to be. The never-takers make more sense in this context: some people may not attend the training even though they were invited to do so. We will not worry about this; the point is that we can conceptually distinguish these groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the effect of the training program on earnings. We denote by $\\beta$ the expected earnings without training. The expected earnings with training is denoted by $\\beta+\\tau$. Hence, $\\tau$ denotes the treatment effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $j \\in \\{c,a,n \\}$ denote whether an individual is a complier, always-taker or never-taker. We assume that $\\beta_j$ and $\\tau_j$ vary with $j$.\n",
