** this lecture
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-lecture
   :END:

- in this lecture, we look at:

  - motivation to learn python
  - typing texts in markdown and latex
  - markdown files on github
  - first assignment
  - first look at jupyter server

** motivation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: motivation
   :END:

-  in this course we teach you

   -  to combine rigorous economics
   -  and how to present it in an understandable way
   -  while your results can be easily reproduced

-  in the python track we do this by teaching you

   -  a programming language: python
   -  how to create notebooks where you can explain your code and
   -  publish them on-line

** things to learn
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: examples
   :END:

- when you finish this course, you can

  - solve models in python
  - do simulations in python
  - create a file or notebook like [[https://janboone.github.io/python_economics/economics.html][this]]

** finishing the course
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: finishing-the-course
   :END:

- helps you to present economics in a way that is

   -  understandable and
   -  reproducible

- gives a good starting point to write your thesis
- check [[https://janboone.github.io/applied-economics/index.html][the website]] and Canvas for relevant information

* Office and Excel
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: office-excel-and-word
  :END:

**  Excel is great for programming?

+ [[https://twitter.com/philipbstark/status/498683914592862208][check this]]
+ indeed, simple things can be done in excel
+ e.g. keep track of your grades and calculate the average
+ but possibilities are limited: it is not a programming language
+ however, the main problem is reproducibility
+ if you've done a serious project in excel, look at it again in 3 months time...


* Open source word processing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: open-source-word-processing
  :END:


** markdown
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: markdown
   :END:

-  see Tirole (2017: 447) for an explanation why open source is so powerful
-  markdown allows you to create structure in a simple way
-  examples are:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

        # this is a heading

        ## subheading

        * first bullet
        * second bullet

        [link text](actual link, e.g. http://www.etc)

        ![Alt text for image](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")
#+END_EXAMPLE

-  look on the web for other syntax like footnotes etc.
-  equations you can type in latex

** latex
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: latex
   :END:

-  latex is great word processing software
-  you should consider writing your thesis in latex
-  but for now, we focus on writing math in latex
-  you can guess what the following will do:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $x^2$, $\beta$, $\sqrt{9}$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $\bar x$

    \begin{equation}

    a^2 + b^2 = c^2

    \end{equation}
#+END_EXAMPLE

-  if you need something, just google; e.g. "google latex phi" or
   "google latex empty set" etc.

* What do you need?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: what-do-you-need
  :END:

** Install software
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: install-software
   :END:

- you do not need to install anything for the course
- you will be working on the [[https://russet.uvt.nl/hub/home][jupyter server]]
- if you also want to install things on your computer, use the [[https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/][anaconda distribution]]

* Working in the cloud
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: working-in-the-cloud
  :END:

** github
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: github
   :END:

- github allows you to

  - publish web pages (gh-pages)
  - work "in the cloud" with version control
  - collaborate in the cloud
  - have different versions ("branches") of the same project

- version control takes a bit of time to learn
- but once you get it, the benefits are huge!
- for this course learning git is optional
- you can just drag and drop your notebooks on github as we will practice in class
- you need github to submit your final python assignment (using github classroom)


* Rules of the game
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: rules-of-the-game
  :END:

** to learn python we use [[https://www.datacamp.com/home][datacamp]] and lectures:

  - you need to finish the datacamp courses in time
  - otherwise you will be lost during the lectures
  - see the [[id:39F7FAD7-56BA-49D0-8424-7EB8F8839E41][Lecture schedule]] for the deadlines
  - for the python part, attend my lectures in the [[id:39F7FAD7-56BA-49D0-8424-7EB8F8839E41][Lecture schedule]]
  - if you want to learn everything on your own, you do not need to attend my lectures
  - but if you do attend the lectures, you participate actively
  - you do not learn python by passively typing in answers!

** to get a grade for the python track:

  - finish assignment 1 (see below) before the deadline
  - attend the career services workshops
  - read [[https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10919.html][Tirole's book]] to get ideas on how to work with economics "in the real world"; this will help you with the final assignment and with your thesis
  - [[id:A5BAF826-823B-4CE7-AB70-F9BD310CE96A][Final Assignment]]
  - [[id:D000098A-D12D-4E06-9F7A-2C2549B03236][Deadlines]] for the final assignment


* Assignment 1
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: assignment
  :END:

+ follow and finish [[id:1BBFB9ED-F701-42A8-B620-03FD6AFB73A2][these 4 steps]]
+ type your first python and markdow at the [[https://russet.uvt.nl/hub/home][jupyter server]]
